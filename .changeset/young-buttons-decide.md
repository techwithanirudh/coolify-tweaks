chore: add optimized OG preview image for better social media sharing

Added a new `og-image.png` (1280x640px) optimized for Open Graph previews. This image improves how the repository appears when shared on social media platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, and Slack. Also added documentation explaining how to set it as the GitHub repository social preview.
