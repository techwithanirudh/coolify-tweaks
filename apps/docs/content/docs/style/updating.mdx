## Introduction

There are two ways to use Coolify Tweaks: 
- Installing it directly into **Stylus** 
- Installing it using the **Dynamic Config**. 

Both approaches receive updates, but they handle them differently.

## Stylus

Stylus installs via the install URL are managed through Stylus' built-in update system. Whenever a new release is available you have two options:

1. Manually reinstall by re-importing the updated stylesheet.
2. Visit the same install URL in Stylus and click **Update**.
   
   Note: Usually Stylus will automatically update the stylesheet when a new release is available.

Some notes:

- Updates apply per browser/profile where Stylus is installed.
- If you pinned a specific version manually, you'll need to re-import when you want to move to a newer release.

## Dynamic Config

If you are using the dynamic-config installation, no manual steps are required for updates.

- The injected stylesheet URL points at the latest published release (for example `.../release/latest/?asset=main.css`).
- When a new version of Coolify Tweaks is released, the proxy automatically serves the new CSS on the next request (subject to normal browser caching).
- Every user visiting through that proxy gets the updated styles at the same time, without needing Stylus or any browser extension.

## Summary
**Stylus** installs are updated from inside Stylus (or by re-importing), while the **Dynamic Config** tracks the latest version automatically once configured.
