## Introduction

Coolify Tweaks receives regular updates with bug fixes, new features, and improvements. The update process depends on your installation method.

## Stylus

Stylus manages updates through its built-in update system. Here's how it works:

### Automatic updates

Stylus automatically checks for updates when:
- The extension loads
- You open the Stylus popup
- You visit a page where the style is active
- The update check interval elapses (usually every 24 hours)

When an update is available, Stylus will show a notification badge on the extension icon, or it will automatically update the style.

### Manual updates

- Open the Stylus extension settings
- Open the editor for the "coolify-tweaks" style
- Copy the Update URL
![Stylus Update URL](/assets/installation/stylus/update-url.png)
- Open the URL in a new tab and click the Update / Install button. This will manually update the style.

### Notes

- Updates apply per browser/profile where Stylus is installed
- If you pinned a specific version, you'll need to unpin or re-import to get updates
- Custom themes: If you're using a themed URL, updates will preserve your theme ID

## Dynamic Config

Dynamic Config installations update automatically since they always point to the latest release.

### How it works

The injected URL in your Traefik config points to:
```
https://coolify-tweaks-api.techwithanirudh.com/release/latest/?asset=main.css
```

This means:
- **No manual steps required**: New releases are served automatically
- Updates apply to all users immediately (subject to browser caching)
- The CSS is fetched fresh on each page load from the API

### Verifying updates

To confirm you're on the latest version:

1. Check the page source (View → Developer → View Source)
2. Look for the injected stylesheet link in the `<head>`
3. The URL should point to `/release/latest/` (not a specific version)

### Clearing cache

If updates seem delayed, clear your browser cache or do a hard refresh:
- **Chrome/Edge:** `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- **Firefox:** `Ctrl+F5` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
