## Introduction

Stylus is the quickest way to get Coolify Tweaks running inside your browser. It injects the userstyle every time the dashboard loads, meaning you can try new tweaks instantly and disable them just as fast.

## Prerequisites

- The [Stylus extension](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) installed in the browser you use for Coolify.

## Installation steps

1. Click the badge below to install the latest build. Stylus will pull the newest release via the [API](/docs/api).

   <a
     href="https://coolify-tweaks-api.techwithanirudh.com/release/latest/?asset=main.user.css"
     target="_blank"
   >
     <img
       src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-116b59.svg?longCache=true&style=flat"
       alt="Install with Stylus"
     />
   </a>

   **OR**

   <a
     href="https://userstyles.world/style/22850/coolify-enhanced-ui"
     target="_blank"
   >
     <img
       src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20from-userstyles.world-116b59.svg?longCache=true&style=flat"
       alt="Install from userstyles.world"
     />
   </a>

2. If your Coolify instance runs on a custom domain, open the style's **Settings** and add a wildcard entry under **Custom included sites** so the CSS can load everywhere you reach the dashboard:

   <img
     src="/assets/installation/stylus/settings.png"
     alt="Stylus Settings"
     className="mx-auto max-h-128 rounded-md invert"
   />

   ```text
   *://your.coolify.host:8000/*
   ```

3. Enable **Instant Mode** in Stylus so the style injects immediately instead of waiting for DOM stabilization. This prevents visual glitches while Stylus applies the tweak.

   <img
     src="/assets/installation/stylus/instant-mode.png"
     alt="Stylus Instant Mode"
     className="mx-auto max-h-128 rounded-md"
   />

## Custom themes

Stylus can point at themed releases by changing the install URL:

```
https://coolify-tweaks-api.techwithanirudh.com/release/latest/?theme=THEME_ID&asset=main.user.css
```

Replace `THEME_ID` with the ID copied from [https://tweakcn.com/editor/theme](https://tweakcn.com/editor/theme). Because the URL still ends with `main.user.css`, Stylus treats it as the same style but with a different palette.

More information about custom themes can be found in the [Theming](/docs/style/theming) section.

## Troubleshooting

- **Host not matched**: Confirm the wildcard entry covers your domain/port (e.g., `*://coolify.local:*/*`).
- **Theme seems stale**: Reinstall the style from the badge, and force-reload the page.
