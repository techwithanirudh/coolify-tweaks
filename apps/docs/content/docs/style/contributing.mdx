## Requirements

- **Node.js** `^22.21.0`
- **PNPM** `^10.19.0`
- **Bun** `^1.0.0` (used to run TypeScript scripts for the docs and style pipelines instead of `ts-node`)
- A Postgres/Neon database URL if you’re touching anything analytics/API-related

## Quick start (5–10 minutes)

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/techwithanirudh/coolify-tweaks.git
   cd coolify-tweaks
   ```
2. **Install dependencies + env**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. **Set up the database** (only if you need the API/analytics)
   ```bash
   pnpm db:push
   ```
4. **Run what you care about**
   ```bash
   # Style-only Sass watcher (serves CSS on http://localhost:3000)
   pnpm --filter @repo/style dev

   # Docs site (Next.js dev server on http://localhost:3002)
   pnpm --filter @repo/docs dev

   # API server (optional, for release proxy/analytics)
   pnpm --filter @repo/api dev
   ```
5. **Make changes, run checks, send a PR**
   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   pnpm format
   pnpm typecheck
   ```

If you get stuck on setup, open an issue or draft PR with what you tried—screenshots help.

## Where to make changes

- **Styles / theming**
  - Edit Sass in `apps/style/src/**`.
  - Keep the dual installation story in mind: Stylus vs Traefik Dynamic Config.
  - If you change how installation or updates work, please update **both** `updating.mdx` and `installation/dynamic-config.mdx` so the docs stay in sync.
- **Docs**
  - MDX lives under `apps/docs/content/**`.
  - Components/layout live under `apps/docs/src/app/**`.
  - Run `pnpm --filter @repo/docs dev` and use the in-browser search to find the page you’re editing.
- **API / DB**
  - API handlers live in `apps/api/src/**`.
  - Database schemas and helpers live in `packages/db/**`.
  - When you change schemas, regenerate and push migrations (`pnpm db:push`).

For a full overview of apps, packages, and tooling, see the “About” section in the root [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../../../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Branches, commits, and PRs

- Work on a branch named after what you’re doing, e.g. `feat/new-theme-toggle` or `docs/fix-installation-copy`.
- Use Conventional Commits (`feat: …`, `fix: …`, `docs: …`); commitlint + lefthook will nudge you if something is off.
- Keep PRs focused: one clear change (or set of related tweaks) per PR is easier to review.

Once CI is green and the PR has a review, it can be merged; release automation and deployments are handled separately.
