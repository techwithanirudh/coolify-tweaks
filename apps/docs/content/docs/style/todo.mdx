- [ ] Add a introduction guide, describing the project and the purpose of the project, and not its relation to coolify (add a thing in copyright footer and readme its not related to coolify)
- [ ] Add the Analytics Tracking DB
- [ ] Fix the Ugly Colors
- [ ] Coolify Tweaks API, and development mode for tweaks api that will piggyback on localhost:3000 and auto reload once it changes + theme injection
- changelog
- contributing setup
- move openapi section insline
- tweakcn theming custom component to enter theme id / theme css and get the url

all sections like the traefik and tweakcn will have both manual and automatic installation guides.

for the tweakcn one, it will have a custom component to enter theme id / theme css and get the tweaks url, and for theme css it will programatically call the api to get the tweaks url.

- updating section
- move the root to the /docs section and add a landing page like fumadocs does
- move to api.coolify-tweaks.techwithanirudh.com
- add contributing guide to each section, like api, style, docs. so it's easier to contribute. include how to get the dev server running, how to deploy, what tests ci / cd i mean.

Landing Page:
Move X Icons to it's own directory i mean icons.tsx through svgl
Define two images for the landing, dark and light so we dont invert so it looks good on both modes.
Integrate the new testimonials section into the landing page.
take inspiration from next-forge, and shadcn-saas-landing.
- use a proper logo for the landing page.
- use a new font that matches the design.

add visualizations for the features section.
