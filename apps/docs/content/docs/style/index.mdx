Coolify Tweaks is A theme that refines spacing, typography, and colors. It keeps the interface familiar while smoothing out rough edges, making everything feel more intentional without rebuilding the UI.

You can check out the [screenshots](/docs/style/screenshots) page to see the difference between the original and the tweaked version.

> Coolify Tweaks is not affiliated with Coolify or its developers. It is a standalone project that styles the dashboard on your behalf.

## How does it work?

There are two supported install paths today:

- **Stylus (browser extension)** injects the CSS on load, so every refresh floats the themed styles right on top of Coolify.
- **Dynamic Config (Traefik rewrite)** rewrites Coolify's HTML responses, which means every browser and device hitting your dashboard picks up the tweak without installing anything extra.

## Quick start

Pick the workflow that matches your setup:

<Cards>
  <Card
    href="/docs/style/installation/stylus"
    title="Stylus"
    icon={<Palette />}
  >
    Install the userstyle via Stylus, add your host, and enable Instant Mode for
    consistent renders.
  </Card>
  <Card
    href="/docs/style/installation/dynamic-config"
    title="Dynamic Config"
    icon={<Settings2 />}
  >
    Inject the tweaks through Traefik's `rewrite-body` plugin so every dashboard
    response includes the CSS.
  </Card>
</Cards>
