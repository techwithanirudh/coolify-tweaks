Coolify Tweaks API is a lightweight Nitro server that serves `coolify-tweaks` release assets with optional [TweakCN](https://tweakcn.com) theme injection. It keeps the userstyle install links fast, consistent, and free from GitHub CDN hiccups.

## Why This Exists

- **Bypass CDN quirks**: serve release assets directly without CORS surprises.
- **Dynamic theme injection**: apply TweakCN themes on demand so every install link stays themed.
- **Edge-friendly**: deploys on Vercel (Nitro) with smart caching and global reach.

## Themes

1. Client requests CSS with `?theme=<theme-id>`.
2. API fetches the base userstyle asset from GitHub.
3. Server pulls the requested theme from TweakCN and injects its variables.
4. Post-processing rewrites the CSS so it is ready to install with Stylus.
