Coolify Tweaks API is a lightweight Nitro server that serves `coolify-tweaks` release assets with optional [TweakCN](https://tweakcn.com) theme injection. It keeps the userstyle install links fast, consistent, and free from GitHub CDN hiccups.

The CDN is hosted on Vercel.

## Why This Exists

- **Bypass CDN quirks** – serve release assets directly without CORS surprises.
- **Dynamic theme injection** – apply TweakCN themes on demand so every install link stays themed.
- **Edge-friendly** – deploys on Vercel (Nitro) with smart caching and global reach.

## Usage

### `GET /release/:tag`

Fetch a release asset (defaults to `main.user.css`) with optional theme injection.

- `asset` – asset filename, defaults to `main.user.css`
- `theme` – TweakCN theme identifier for CSS transformation

Examples:

- `/release/latest`
- `/release/v3.8.10`
- `/release/latest?theme=claude`
- `/release/latest?asset=coolify-tweaks.zip`
