  This update is all about giving Coolify a nice visual makeover‚Äîcleaner, smoother styles and just an all-around better feel:

  #### üé® Smarter Colors & Themes
  - **Custom Theming**: The new version now supports the ShadCN theming spec, allowing you to **fully customize** your Coolify instance to look unique. Customize using [tweakcn.com](https://tweakcn.com/).
  - Tidied up the color variables for clearer theming and better contrasts
  - Improved semantic tokens so it's actually easy to tell what's going on
  - Dark mode looking much slicker (thanks to better handling with color-mix)
  - Renamed color tokens to simpler stuff like `foreground` and `muted-foreground`‚Äîmakes sense now!

  #### üß© Component Polish
  - Sidebar layout cleaned up, way more consistent
  - Inputs, buttons, selects‚Äîall have nicer focus and hover interactions

  #### ‚ú® UI Improvements
  - Tables fixed up and sidebar colors adjusted for better harmony
  - Deployment cards styled properly, plus a nice cleanup in `misc.scss`
  - Navbar links are now easier on the eyes
  - Hover effects got a sweet upgrade and inputs give better feedback
  - Logs are now using monospaced fonts

  #### üõ†Ô∏è Code Cleanup & Consistency
  - Border radius and padding consistent throughout‚Äîlooks neat
  - Hover and focus styles tightened up globally

  #### üêõ Little (but important) Fixes
  - Font issues squashed‚Äîno more weird glitches
  - Fixed some pesky typos in class selectors
  - Labels now have proper spacing and feel uniform
  - Monaco editor respects radius and overflow properly now

  This update smooths everything out and makes Coolify feel way more unified‚Äînothing breaks, just a nicer, themeable experience overall.
